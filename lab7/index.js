David Allen Emanuel, 61, was arrested after his alleged attack against a group of seven people standing outside of a property in Rosewood, including Florida International University professor emeritus Dr Marvin Dunn and his son Douglas Dunn, the Miami Herald reported. Dr Dunn said the group was discussing plans to build an educational house about the states racist history on the property he purchased ten years ago when Mr Emanuel approached them, asking what they were doing and why Mr Dunns car was parked outside Mr Emanuels property. When Dr Dunn attempted to explain that it was legal to park on the road, Mr Emanuel allegedly went inside his pickup truck and drove towards the group while screaming the n-word at them. Dr Dunn said his son was nearly hit. The incident was reported to police but an arrest was not made until several days later on Monday, following demands from Dr Dunn via email and on social media to the Levy County Sheriffs Office to investigate the incident. The incident, Dr Dunn told the Miami New Times, happened at the only Black-owned property in Rosewood, a once prospering prominently Black community that was mostly destroyed during a racial massacre in 1923.';

ABCs Central Florida affiliate WFTV reports David Emerson Proudfoot, 44, of Kissimmee, was arrested on May 31 after he snatched the droid from Disney Worlds Swan Hotel in an attempt to get hired as a security guard at the Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando. According to police, Proudfoot was seen by hotel security pushing a cart on the property while wearing an orange work vest and a Disney World name tag. Security guards, who suspected something suspicious was taking place, subsequently escorted Proudfoot to the Yacht Club Resort to retrieve his belongings and drivers license from the employee lockers, at which point Disney officials called law enforcement. Proudfoot allegedly told police he had a pending application with Walt Disney World Security, and only was moving the R2-D2 replica in an effort to “show weaknesses in the security of the resorts,” with the hope of landing a job at the resort. He also later admitted to breaking into three separate arcade machines at Disneys Wilderness Lodge, Boardwalk Resort, and the Grand Floridian Resort. Proudfoot has been charged with two counts of grand theft, one count of petit theft, one count of obstruction by false information and one count of scheming to defraud. According to court records, he made a written plea of not guilty on June 24.';
